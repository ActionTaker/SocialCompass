### [US3: Persistence of house locations](https://github.com/CSE-110-Winter-2023/cse-110-project-cse110-team-20/milestone/1)
> **_NOTE:_** : As a user I want the app to still work even after it is killed and restarted so that I don't have to reenter the information again (just to see in which direction my friends and parents are)

**To-do list:**
- [ ] T3-1: Create a structure to save a waypoint such as a sharedpreferences.

- [ ] T3-2: On the input screen, add a button or prompt to take in a name and coordinate, then send it to the structure holding waypoints.
- [ ] T3-3: For the structure that stores the waypoint, make it so that it will store it even if the app is closed 
- [ ] T3-4: Testing
### [US4: Location and orientation update over time](https://github.com/CSE-110-Winter-2023/cse-110-project-cse110-team-20/milestone/1)
> **_NOTE:_** : As a user I want the app to continue to update the location and orientation so that I can continue to see which direction is up over time

**To-do list:**
- [ ] T4-1: Record what the current location of the user is
- [ ] T4-2: Take in the saved locations and use User story 2 to see what direction they are from your current location
- [ ] T4-3: Add in something similar to what is in Lab 5 to continuously check your location and and run T4-2 in real-time
- [ ] T4-4: In the continuous check, also keep on updating and changing values on the compass screen to match the changing location
- [ ] T4-5: Testing
